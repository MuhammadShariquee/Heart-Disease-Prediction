# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the presence of cardiovascular disease using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Dataset
Mendeley Cardiovascular Disease Dataset: [Link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading & Exploration  
2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling  
3. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning  
4. Model Evaluation & Comparison  
5. Feature Importance Analysis (Random Forest)

## Results
Random Forest performed the best with:
- Accuracy: 98.33%
- Precision: 98.16%
- Recall: 98.76%
- F1-score: 98.46%

## Libraries Required
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
